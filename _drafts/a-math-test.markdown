 **Can math be used?**
 **this is in bold**  and __so is this__
 
The following is a math block:

<h1>Small cancellation theory</h1>

1. H is nice

2. L is okay



$$ 5 + 5 $$

# But next comes a paragraph with an inline math statement:

\$$ 5 + 5 $$

## Okay how about something a bit more complicated?

If $$ A $$ is a subset of a group $$ G $$ the normal closure of $$ A $$ in $$ G $$ is the smallest normal subgroup of $$ G $$ containing $$ A $$ and we will denote it $$ A^G $$.  A free group on a set $$ S $$ will be denoted $$ F_S $$ and a free group of rank  (free group on $$ n $$ elements) will be denoted $$ F_n $$.

Okay so $$ F $$ give inline, how about 

$$ LDFD $$  kjfdke \$$ j \$$ $$ kkk$$ John

and 

$$ H $$
