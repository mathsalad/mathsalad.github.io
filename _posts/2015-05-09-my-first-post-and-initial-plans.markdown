title: My first post, a test, and some possible future writings
--- 
My first plans, when I get everything together, including getting this site together, is to talk about:

* Selection principles, and related "statements"
* Some basic small cancellation theory of group, following Ol'shanskii's book "Geometry of Defining Relations in Groups"
* How small cancellation theory helped me solve a problem that came up in a project for a class called "Selection principles in topology" (which I have not solved yet, but pretty sure small cancellation theory will solve it, and will be important in solving it...)
