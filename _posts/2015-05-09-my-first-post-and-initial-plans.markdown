My first plans, when I get everything together, including getting this site together, is to talk about:

* Selection principles, and related ideas
* Some basic small cancellation theory of groups, following Ol'shanskii's book "Geometry of Defining Relations in Groups"
* How small cancellation theory helped me solve a problem that came up in a project for a class called "selection principles in topology."
