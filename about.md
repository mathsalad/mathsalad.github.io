##About the blog

I will mostly write on mathematical things. The title **Math Salad** is a play on the phrase [word salad][wordsalad].

For now, there is no comment system. Most math blogs don't get many comments, so I suspect this won't really be a problem. You can email me corrections or comments. If a comment you send to me seems appropriate I can add it to the relavant post. Also don't be afraid to comment critisism, I am glad to try to make things more clear or correct things if necessary.

I am using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to create the website, and the theme [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) which is based off the theme [Poole](http://getpoole.com/).

###A bit about me

My name is Paul Plummer and I am currently a graduate student in mathematics. It appears my main research interested lies in [geometric group theory][ggt](GGT), but I am interested in much of mathematics. Lately I have been learning and thinking about mapping class groups of surfaces, curve graphs, arc graphs, etc. graphs and their geometry (Spring 2017).

I came to geometric group theory from a somewhat strange direction: I had an (undergraduate) algebra class where, as an asignment, I had write a paper, I choose to write about the [Burnside problems][burnside]. In finding information for the paper I found *Groups Graphs and Trees* By John Meier, but also happened to completely miss connections to [small cancellation theory][sct]. Later I had a topics in set theory course (I almost became a set theorist), and for a project in that class I found small cancellation theory, which introduced me to many aspects of geometric group theory.
