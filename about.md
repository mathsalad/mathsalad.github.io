I am a person, that does math... Currently not in school. 

I will mostly write on mathematical things, maybe a few other things too, but mostly math. The math I will be things that I am doing, possibly of no interest, importance, or originality, but I like it. There is a chance it also won't make any sense, hence the blog title **Math Salad**, a play on the phrase [word salad][wordsalad].
