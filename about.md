My name is Paul Plummer and at the moment I am not attending school.

I will mostly write on mathematical things, some times other things, but mostly math. The math will probably be of no interest, importance, or originality, but I like it. There is a chance it won't make any sense, hence the blog title **Math Salad**, a play on the phrase [word salad][wordsalad].

For now, there is no comment system. Most math blogs don't get many comments, so I suspect this won't really be a problem. You can email me corrections or comments (comments are for me, they won't be published) at the email link in the sidebar.

I am using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to create the website, and the theme [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com/) which is based off the theme [Poole](http://getpoole.com/).
