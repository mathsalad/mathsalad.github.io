<p>My first plans, when I get everything together, including getting this site together, is to talk about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Selection principles, and related ideas</li>
  <li>Some basic small cancellation theory of groups, following Ol’shanskii’s book “Geometry of Defining Relations in Groups”</li>
  <li>How small cancellation theory helped me solve a problem that came up in a project for a class called “selection principles in topology.” </li>
</ul>
