<p>I will mostly write on mathematical things. The title <strong>Math Salad</strong> is a play on the phrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_salad">word salad</a>.</p>

<p>For now, there is no comment system. Most math blogs don’t get many comments, so I suspect this won’t really be a problem. You can email me corrections or comments. If a comment you send to me seems appropriate I can add it to the relavant post. Also don’t be afraid to comment critisism, I am glad to try to make things more clear or correct things if necessary.</p>

<p>I am using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to create the website.</p>

<h3 id="a-bit-about-me">A bit about me</h3>

<p>My name is Paul Plummer and I am currently a graduate student in mathematics. It appears my main research interested lies in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_group_theory">geometric group theory</a>(GGT), but I am interested in much of mathematics. Lately I have been learning and thinking about mapping class groups of surfaces, curve graphs, arc graphs, etc. graphs and their geometry (Spring 2017).</p>

<p>I came to geometric group theory from a somewhat strange direction: I had an (undergraduate) algebra class where, as an asignment, I had write a paper, I choose to write about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnside_problem">Burnside problems</a>. In finding information for the paper I found <em>Groups Graphs and Trees</em> By John Meier, but also happened to completely miss connections to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_cancellation_theory">small cancellation theory</a>. Later I had a topics in set theory course (I almost became a set theorist), and for a project in that class I found small cancellation theory, which introduced me to many aspects of geometric group theory.</p>
